// Methods of String

// Length - Also Count the Spaces

// CharAt- Tell the character based on the index
console.log(newName.charAt(10)); /* k */

// IndexOf - Tell the index of the INDEX based on Character, It is case senstive
console.log(newName.indexOf("T")); /* 7 */

// At - Takes integer value and returns the item at that index, allowing for positive and negative integers.
console.log(newName.at(0)); /* A */
console.log(newName.at(-1)); /* r */

// subString - returns the part of the string between the start and end indexes, or to the end of the string.
/* 1st - indexStart - index of the first character to include in the returned substring. */
/* IndexEnd is optional, IndexEnd element is not included */
console.log(newName.substring(0)); /* Ankush Thakur */

// Slice - Same as SubString, but Negitive value is also allowed
console.log(newName.slice(0)); /* Ankush Thakur */
console.log(newName.slice(1, 5)); /* nkus*/
console.log("CCCC", newName.slice(-6, 13)); /* Thakur*/

// concate - It concatenates the string arguments to this string and returns a new string.
// BUT RECOMMENED IS INTERPOLATION
console.log(newName, myName);

// Includes - performs a case-sensitive search, It cannot be Regex
console.log(newName.includes("Anku")); /* True */
console.log(newName.includes("Anks")); /* False */
console.log(newName.includes("Anshika")); /* False */

// lastIndexOf()  - searches this string and returns the index of the last occurrence, if not found then -1
// IT IS A CASE SENSITIVE
const paragraph = "I think Ruth's dog is cuter than your dog! is";

// match() - retrieves the result of matching this string against a regular expression.
const regex =
  /[A-Z]/g; /* Capital A to Z, /g - stands for global flags,  When this flag is used, searches for all matches within the entire string. Without this flag, it would only find the first match and then stop. */

//replace() -  returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement

// charCodeAt() -  returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code, ONLY return the integer

// charCodeAt() - returns a non-negative integer that is the Unicode code point value
